/* 
  Hot Air Balloon by Richard Bourne, created June 26, 2023 for the #WCCChallenge 'Floating'. A few years back when I had a chance to take a hot air balloon ride, I 
	talked to the pilot about his technique. He explained that a hot air balloon does not fly at a constant altitude. 
  It constantly rises and falls as the propane burner is turned on and off by the pilot. The trick is to keep
	the height oscillations to a minimum range, thereby conserving fuel.
	
  This was an experiment to create an animation with synchronized sound. I thought I would need 
	to play the sound each time the burner came on, and stop it when the burner shut off. But due to some
	uncanny luck, the free hot air burner sound I downloaded was the right length to end in sync with the flame,
	so I only needed the stop command once. Each burst is triggered by frameCount every 630 frames. The burn 
	cycle shown in this sketch is speeded up quite a bit compared to one in a real-life flight.
